The Unicon Windows plugin allows you to connect to Windows systems with command line interface (CMD shell).

This is an experimental plugin, there are some issues with ANSI stripping and powershell is not supported.

The following generic services are available:

  * `execute`_
  * `send`_
  * `sendline`_
  * `expect`_

.. _execute: generic_services.html#execute
.. _send: generic_services.html#send
